## Quality arguments

Our interface stands out as a high-quality user experience, defined by its dynamic logic, user-friendly design, and responsiveness. Below are key arguments that demonstrate why our interface is exceptional:

**1. Dynamic and Adaptive Logic:**
The core of our interface's excellence lies in its sophisticated logic system, designed to dynamically respond to user inputs. This system doesn't just execute pre-determined pathways; it adapts based on the user's interactions. For each section, we meticulously set local variables and display orders, ensuring a smooth, logical progression that feels intuitive to the user. This adaptive approach significantly enhances the user experience by making the interface seem almost anticipatory of user needs.

**2. Modular Component Design:**
We utilized a wide range of UI components, each carefully chosen and implemented to ensure easy updates and modifications. This modularity means that our interface is not only tailored for current requirements but is also ready for future enhancements without extensive overhauls. Components are organized cleanly, making revisions straightforward and less error-prone for developers. This foresight in design supports sustainability and adaptability, key markers of a high-quality interface.

**3. Simplicity and Intuitiveness:**
Users often remarked on the simplicity and intuitiveness of our interface. The common feedback was, "Is that all?"—a testament to the interface's ease of use. Tasks that traditionally take multiple steps without our interface could be completed in just a few clicks with ours. This simplicity empowers users, reducing the cognitive load and making the technology accessible to a broader audience.

**4. Detailed and Responsive Feedback:**
We have received significant positive feedback about the detailed and responsive nature of our interface. Every action a user takes is met with immediate and clear feedback. For example, numerical data and progress bars are not only accurately calculated but are displayed in a manner that is meaningful and easily digestible for users. This level of detail ensures that users are never in doubt about the impact of their actions, enhancing trust and satisfaction.

**5. User Testimonials and UI Screenshots:**
To illustrate these points, user testimonials highlight the efficiency and ease of use. One user mentioned, "I was able to complete my tasks quickly and with no confusion, a stark contrast to other platforms I've used." Accompanying screenshots of the UI show its clean layout and logical flow, visually supporting our claims about the interface's usability and aesthetic appeal.

In summary, our interface excels because it is user-centric, adaptable, and detail-oriented, making it not just functional but a pleasure to use. Its design anticipates future needs, ensuring longevity and continued relevance in an evolving tech landscape. This combination of features makes our interface truly great, setting a benchmark for what effective UI design should look like.

## Quality arguments - 규호

1. Risk management through budget allocation by category

Functions for safety are usually inconvenient for users. It directly prevents the user from doing what he or she wants to do with an error message. This experience of being stopped is not pleasant and has a negative impact on the user experience.

Our services allow minors (individuals with limited ability to take responsibility) to freely consume. So we received feedback that we needed to pay more attention to safety, and we thought deeply about it. Category-based risk management is the result of our thinking.

Our service allows users to allocate their budget by category. This is to limit minors from using their budget for things they shouldn't. The reason we think this feature is cool is because it makes users feel less limited, even though they are actually limited. Our service doesn't say, "Don't spend your money on that." We just say, “We’ve run out of budget for that category.”


## Iteration

We mainly used the DP6 period for iteration to fix user problems discovered in DP5. The process can be divided into two stages.

- The stage of distinguishing between what we will accept and what we will not accept among the discovered user problems.
- The stage of fixing user problems that we accepted

We set a standard for deciding what to accept and what not to accept. The standard is that if we determine that our modification is likely to cause another user problem, we will not reflect that modification. The reason for this decision is that since there is no opportunity for another iteration, there is no opportunity to make corrections if there is a problem with the newly added product. Because we wanted to finish the prototype as complete as possible, we agreed to fix the existing functions and made modifications.

Below are the user problems we decided to accept and the fixes we made.

Problem 1: It is not intuitive to check whether you agree or disagree with the terms and conditions. When attempting to disagree, a message immediately pops up stating that consent is required, which confuses users.

- Instead of blocking the unchecking of the agreement, we made the payment button not clickable if the user does not agree.

Problem 2: The screen when a payment does not proceed due to budget exceedance is similar to the screen when the payment is successfully completed, making it difficult for the user to notice that the budget has been exceeded.

- We displayed the fact that the budget has been exceeded in large letters at the top of the screen, and made the positions where the used amount and remaining budget are displayed closer together so that users can intuitively know that the budget has been exceeded.


## Individual Reflection - Gyuho Lee
#### What part of the interface did you contribute to?

The category-specific consumption management interface, which is a core feature of our interface, was designed by me. Also, the idea of ​​adding a message to the interface and the idea of ​​enabling family invitations via SMS and invite code were all my ideas.

I contributed to the interface, but more than that, I contributed to the team by writing team report. With limited time, our team had to do a lot of work,  so interface improvement and team report writing were done simultaneously in one pipeline, and I was mainly responsible for writing the team report. I contributed greatly to writing the team project report. From DP1 to DP6, I feel like I wrote about 80% of the reports.

#### What worked well and not in your team?

Our team got almost everything done right. Among them, division of labor seems to have been achieved the best. Rather than everyone being stuck on the same task, which reduces efficiency, each person found what they needed to do and worked efficiently.

On the other hand, it was relatively difficult to unify opinions. Because each person expressed their opinions in abstract terms, it was not easy to understand what each person was saying and it was not easy to unify opinions.

#### How did you overcome any hurdle in teamwork?
We were able to overcome the hurdle by organizing and exchanging our thoughts in writing. After seeing each other's thoughts in concrete writing rather than abstract words, we were able to understand each other's thoughts and figure out exactly where there was a difference of opinion. Also, when we actually wrote down our different thoughts, there were many cases where there was not much difference in the content. This written method of communication helped us unify our opinions.

#### What lesson about teamwork did you learn that you might apply to your next team project?
I learned two lessons about team projects while working on a design project. The first is that written communication, as explained earlier, is very effective. I won't go into detail because I've already explained why it's effective.

As a second lesson, I learned that it is important to distinguish between what the team should do together and what it should do separately. When we all tried to do activities like brainstorming together, ideas didn't come out well due to the pressure of everyone being together. It was even more difficult because there was added pressure to make progress while we were together. I felt it was important for each person to consider in advance what they could do and do it in advance.

#### Through the team-based design project experience, what did you learn about the user-centered design process and UI prototyping?

I thought I would be left with some unexpected insight after the whole journey was over, but that wasn't the case. The words I learned throughout the class, “We are not users,” ultimately stayed in my mind. I kept hearing those words over and over again as problems that I didn't anticipate continued to arise.
