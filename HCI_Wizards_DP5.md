Design Project 5: Usability Testing
====================================
## POV
Minors who rely on parental funding for online purchases need a faster and simple way to get payment permission. A streamlined, real-time method would allow minors to make purchases easily while maintaining necessary parental oversight.

## Tasks

#### Task 1: Complete Food Delivery Payment and Check the Remaining Balance

Connected HMW: HMW allow some categories of consumption to skip the process of getting permission? 

Connected Soultion: Make purchases within specific categories and adhere to preset budget for each category which is set by parents in advance.

#### Task 2: Send Request for Permission and Payment for Clothes

Connected HMW: HMW reduce the time-inefficient steps of authentication when minor uses parent’s card?

Connected Soultion: Send a payment request directly to the parent's device, streamlining the authentication steps needed when using another person’s card.

#### Task 3: Add Another Family Member to Permission Request

Connected HMW: HMW get permission from parents for payment even when they have difficulty to check the messenger?

Connected Soultion: Allow users to add alternate contacts, who are able to approve payments on behalf of initial approver.

#### Task 4: Request Increase on Budget for Book Category

Connected HMW: HMW allow some categories of consumption to skip the process of getting permission? 

Connected Soultion: Make purchases within specific categories and adhere to preset budget for each category which is set by parents in advance.

## Session observations

#### Participants:

#### Who are they? 

We conducted a total of 3 user tests. To protect the personal information of the users who participated in the user test, we will call them nicknames Superman, Ant Man, and Iron Man.

#### How did you recruit them? 

We recruited them from among our acquaintances. Superman and Ant Man were the younger brothers of a friend of our group member, and Iron Man was a friend of another group member. We went through simple communication in the process of recruiting them. We asked them whether they regularly spend money online to see if they fit our target audience. We also informed them of the content of the user tests we would conduct and helped them make their own decisions about whether to participate.

#### Why are they representative target users?
Our target users are minors who engage in online consumption activities. We'll describe the online consumption experiences of the people we tested with to ensure they represent our target users.

#### Superman
Superman usually makes online payments when buying clothes. When he uses online payments, he uses bank transfer. He believes that it is cumbersome to pay by card because it requires entering the card number.

#### Ant Man
Ant Man spends online to buy school supplies. Although he does consume online, he relies on his parents for the entire process. He makes the payment online by finding the items he needs, notifying his parents, and having them complete the rest of the payment process. He said that there were many inconveniences during the payment process, such as the window for payment preparation disappearing and disagreements with parents regarding payment.

#### Iron Man
Iron Man is a 19-year-old college student. As Iron Man lives and lives separately from his parents, he was our extreme user who frequently spends online. He was making online purchases using pay services such as Toss. Even if he used Toss, there were some inconveniences such as requesting money through a separate messenger when he ran out of money.

Demographic, Context information
|Nickname|Age|School|Gender|Nationality|
|--------|---|-----|-------|------------|
|Superman|18|High School|Male|Korean|
|Antman|14|Middle School|Male|Korean|
|Ironman|19|University|Male|Korean|


#### Participant 1: Superman

![superman](https://github.com/hogyulee/cs374/assets/66636839/0e4ac384-4053-4c7e-bc83-2718abe06c79)

Superman was not fluent in English. So when our interface required reading English, it took him longer to understand it. In our app, if you spend more than your budget, a message appears saying that you are over budget, and it took him a long time to understand this. Also, the part about agreeing to the terms and conditions was long to read [Payment Information Confirmation and Personal Information Consent], which made it difficult to understand.

He said he could read English on his own, so we did not prepare a Korean version of the prototype. However, he had difficulty with the English interface. We learned a lesson that from next time we conduct user testing with Koreans, we should prepare a Korean version of the prototype.


#### Participant 2: Ant Man

![antman](https://github.com/hogyulee/cs374/assets/66636839/0c3452f5-4e9c-4c3f-b7b7-80da18ba8527)

What was unique about Ant Man was that he never had his own smartphone. He says he doesn't have much experience with apps since he doesn't use smartphones other than his family's. 

Ant Man had much the same problem as Superman. He wasn't familiar with English, so Ant Man had a hard time understanding it even though he spent time on it. In particular, when it came to agreeing to terms and conditions, he seemed to have no idea what agreement to terms and conditions was. It wasn't a problem with the English language, he just didn't understand its concepts properly. It made us worry about whether it is right to ask consent from a young child who does not know what consent to terms and conditions is.


#### Participant 3: Iron man

![ironman](https://github.com/hogyulee/cs374/assets/66636839/da2d7c41-ffad-4c3b-b5ca-774129bfc4b0)

Iron Man did not experience much difficulty in user testing. He was fluent in English and familiar with the apps' interfaces. Other than a slight confusion between the amount spent and the amount remaining during the budget task, he completed the test with almost no problems. 

He gave us many opinions during the post-user testing interview. He explained to us in detail the functions of apps in alternative positions to our apps, such as Toss and Kakao Mini. He was interested and praised our service's ability to manage spending by dividing into categories. He evaluated that these services could be a differentiator from other apps.



## Usability lessons


||Task/Action|Theme|User Problem|Participants|Severity|
|-|-----------|-----|------------|------------|---------|
|1|[Task 2 Action 3]|visibility| The text description part is too large, so focusing on the crucial interface is difficult.|P3|minor|
|2|[Task 1 Action 10]|terminology| It is difficult to distinguish between the remaining amount and the spent amount in the category tab. (spent amount is not specified, while remaining amount is specified )|P3| major|
|3|[Task 2 Action 3]| terminology| The tab that specifies the payment request target is labeled as family. However, it is not clear that the family tab specifies the payment request target. |P1, P3| minor| 
|4|[Task1 Action 1-3]|terminology|In the payment progress page, it needs to be clarified what 942$ and 33$ each means.|P3|minor|
|5|[Task 1 Action 2]|flow| The back button does not work on the food payment screen. |P1|minor|
|6|[Task 1 Action 5]|flow| It is not intuitive to check whether you agree or disagree with the terms and conditions. When attempting to disagree, a message immediately pops up stating that consent is required, which confuses users.|P2, P3|catastrophic|
|7|[Task 1 Action 10]|flow| It is not clear what period the budget for each displayed category is set based on. (Is it a monthly budget? Is it a weekly budget?)|P3|major|
|8|[Task 4]|flow| In the budget increase request, the period during which the budget increase is applied is unclear. (Is the increase only for one month or permanent?)|P3|major|
|9|[Not related to Task]|flow|It is difficult to figure out how to access the chat again.|P3|minor|
|10|[Not related to Task]|accessibility|It is hard for someone to understand the interface who cannot speak English|P2|minor|

|index|Plan to Address|
|-----|---------------|
|1|reduce the text font size and indicate some important information by coloring|
|2|Change the interface of the category page. Add a description to easily distinguish between the total allowance and the remaining allowance like [total: 1000$] or [remaining: 909.1$].|
|3|Change the labeling. Change “family” to “approver”.|
|4|Add the description "remaining" above the text that shows the balance.|
|5|Change the back button to an X button to indicate that the payment is canceled. And add a function to return to the original window.|
|6|Instead of blocking the unchecking of the agreement, make the payment button not clickable if the user does not agree. |
|7|Indicates the duration for this budget in the Category page.|
|8|Since the parents will decide on this, the user interface will not be significantly changed. However, if one of the previous solutions, the period is displayed in the category, it would be a little clearer.|
|9|Add a “direct message icon” in the family tab in the main page. And Changed the interface of the family page to better display the ability to send messages.|
|10|Add a translation function. However, since our class is an English class, we won't modify this part.|



#### High-level reflections

The following are the lessons we learned while conducting this DP. 

1. About Target User - Young Children 
Our target users are minors, including young children. In this DP, we conducted user testing for the first time with children in middle school or younger. While doing this DP, we learned the meaning of children being the target users.

a. We actively benchmarked existing, well-made apps. This is because we thought that users would already be familiar with the interface of other apps, so if we created a prototype similar to that, users would naturally feel comfortable. But this was not true for young children. Many young children either just got a smartphone or do not have one. They were not familiar with the interfaces of existing apps. This suggested to us that the idea that a good interface is similar to an existing interface may be wrong. 

b. We are building a financial app that requires individual consent. However, young children did not appear to understand this concept. So, other apps usually ask for the consent of a proxy for children. We had missed this point until the previous DP, but we became aware of it when targeting young children. 

2. About language 
In this DP, we conducted user testing with Korean students who could speak English, but even so, some students found the English interface difficult. Even if they could speak English, they felt more uncomfortable than in their native language, which affected user testing. We had two thoughts. The first is that in order to focus on interface testing, other elements such as language must provide a comfortable environment for users as much as possible. The second thing is that an interface that does not have much difficulty in operation even if you feel uncomfortable with the language will be a really good interface.


## Studio Reflections

In the studio, Yeoungung from AC/DC and Chiyoon from What the Park participated in our user testing and provided feedback. 

Yeoungung not only found several problems in our prototype but also suggested good solutions. The most helpful suggestion was the advice regarding “Agree to Terms and Conditions.” When a user tries to cancel their agreement to the terms and conditions, we immediately notify them and prevent them from doing so. However, this feature was a bit inconvenient. We were vaguely aware that the “Agree to Terms and Conditions” section was not intuitive for users, but we had no specific ideas on how to improve it. Yeoungung suggested that we allow users to cancel their agreement to the terms and conditions, and block payments if they try to make a payment after canceling the agreement. We accepted his feedback because we felt this was more intuitive. 

Chiyoon not only informed us of user problems while going through the task, but also gave detailed feedback on features of our prototype that were not included in the task. Unlike other testers, he freely explored the prototype and discovered problems. Thanks to this, we were able to discover problems that had not been discovered before. We made it a task to automatically move to chat through budget requests, so we didn't really consider moving to chat through other methods. However, it was difficult to check the sent chat again, and this problem was discovered thanks to Chiyoon.

## Plan for iteration

1. Adjust Details (Ratio of Bar and Numbers)
   
Goal: Optimize the visibility and interpretability of graphical elements like bars and numerical data.
Detail: Change all the numbers and bars indicating remaining balance to synchronize the flow of the task

2. Unify Icons
   
Goal: Streamline visual language across the platform by standardizing icons.
Detail: Unify icons of the categories to fit the overall design of the application

3. Clarify Notifications
   
Goal: Enhance the clarity and relevance of notifications to improve user interaction.
Detail: Clarify words in notification page to be more intuitive.

4. Differentiate Functionality of Messages
   
Goal: Clearly distinguish between messaging functionalities for different purposes (e.g., monthly budget adjustments vs. single transactions).
Detail: Map out all current functionalities and user flows involving messaging and change it to work as a communication method for adjusting monthly budget and enhance the feature of messaging. 

5. Discard Duplicate Option for Sending Additional Requests
    
Goal: Simplify the process flow by removing redundant options.
Detail: Add new variables for additional approver and available approver to be controlled by prototype interaction. Link them to actual options.
