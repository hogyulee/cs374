Design Project 5: Usability Testing
====================================
## POV
Minors who rely on parental funding for online purchases need a faster and simple way to get payment permission. A streamlined, real-time method would allow minors to make purchases easily while maintaining necessary parental oversight.

## Tasks

#### Task 1: Complete Food Delivery Payment and Check the Remaining Balance

Connected HMW: HMW allow some categories of consumption to skip the process of getting permission? 

Connected Soultion: Make purchases within specific categories and adhere to preset budget for each category which is set by parents in advance.

#### Task 2: Send Request for Permission and Payment for Clothes

Connected HMW: HMW reduce the time-inefficient steps of authentication when minor uses parent’s card?

Connected Soultion: Send a payment request directly to the parent's device, streamlining the authentication steps needed when using another person’s card.

#### Task 3: Add Another Family Member to Permission Request

Connected HMW: HMW get permission from parents for payment even when they have difficulty to check the messenger?

Connected Soultion: Allow users to add alternate contacts, who are able to approve payments on behalf of initial approver.

#### Task 4: Request Increase on Budget for Book Category

Connected HMW:

## Session observations

#### Participants:

#### Who are they? 

We conducted a total of 3 user tests. To protect the personal information of the users who participated in the user test, we will call them nicknames Superman, Ant Man, and Iron Man.

#### How did you recruit them? 

We recruited them from among our acquaintances. Superman and Ant Man were the younger brothers of a friend of our group member, and Iron Man was a friend of another group member. We went through simple communication in the process of recruiting them. We asked them whether they regularly spend money online to see if they fit our target audience. We also informed them of the content of the user tests we would conduct and helped them make their own decisions about whether to participate.

#### Why are they representative target users?
Our target users are minors who engage in online consumption activities. We'll describe the online consumption experiences of the people we tested with to ensure they represent our target users.
#### Superman
Superman usually makes online payments when buying clothes. When he uses online payments, he uses bank transfer. He believes that it is cumbersome to pay by card because it requires entering the card number.
#### Ant Man
Ant Man spends online to buy school supplies. Although he does consume online, he relies on his parents for the entire process. He makes the payment online by finding the items he needs, notifying his parents, and having them complete the rest of the payment process. He said that there were many inconveniences during the payment process, such as the window for payment preparation disappearing and disagreements with parents regarding payment.
#### Iron Man
Iron Man is a 19-year-old college student. As Iron Man lives and lives separately from his parents, he was our extreme user who frequently spends online. He was making online purchases using pay services such as Toss. Even if he used Toss, there were some inconveniences such as requesting money through a separate messenger when he ran out of money.

#### Demographic, Context information
|Nickname|Age|School|Gender|Nationality|
|--------|---|-----|-------|------------|
|Superman|18|High School|Male|Korean|
|Antman|14|Middle School|Male|Korean|
|Ironman|19|University|Male|Korean|


#### Participant 1: Superman

(Photo or sketch of participant)

Superman was not fluent in English. So when our interface required reading English, it took him longer to understand it. In our app, if you spend more than your budget, a message appears saying that you are over budget, and it took him a long time to understand this. Also, the part about agreeing to the terms and conditions was long to read [Payment Information Confirmation and Personal Information Consent], which made it difficult to understand.

He said he could read English on his own, so we did not prepare a Korean version of the prototype. However, he had difficulty with the English interface. We learned a lesson that from next time we conduct user testing with Koreans, we should prepare a Korean version of the prototype.


#### Participant 2: Ant Man

(Photo or sketch of participant)

What was unique about Ant-Man was that he never had his own smartphone. He says he doesn't have much experience with apps since he doesn't use smartphones other than his family's.
Ant Man had much the same problem as Superman. He wasn't familiar with English, so Ant Man had a hard time understanding it even though he spent time on it. In particular, when it came to agreeing to terms and conditions, he seemed to have no idea what agreement to terms and conditions was. It wasn't a problem with the English language, he just didn't understand its concepts properly. It made us worry about whether it is right to ask consent from a young child who does not know what consent to terms and conditions is.
